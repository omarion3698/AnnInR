# Artificial Neural Network with Iris Dataset

This repository contains an implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in R using the Iris dataset. The ANN is built and trained using the `neuralnet` package. The project includes data visualization, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation with various hidden layer configurations.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the Iris dataset. The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- RStudio (optional, but recommended)
- Required R packages: `neuralnet`, `tidyverse`, `keras`, `tensorflow`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ann-iris.git
   cd ann-iris
   ```

2. **Install R and RStudio:**

   Download and install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
   Download and install RStudio from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

3. **Install required R packages:**

   Open R or RStudio and run the following commands:

   ```r
   install.packages(c("neuralnet", "keras", "tensorflow"), dependencies = TRUE)
   install.packages("tidyverse")
   library(neuralnet)
   library(tidyverse)
   ```

4. **Install and configure TensorFlow:**

   ```r
   library(tensorflow)
   install_tensorflow()
   ```

## Usage

1. **Open the R Markdown file:**

   Open the `ann_iris.Rmd` file in RStudio.

2. **Run the R Markdown file:**

   Click the "Knit" button in RStudio to run the entire R Markdown file and generate the output.

## Model Architecture

The ANN is built with varying configurations of hidden layers to evaluate performance:

- **Model 1:** Two hidden layers with 4 and 2 neurons.
- **Model 2:** Three hidden layers with 8, 4, and 2 neurons.
- **Model 3:** Ten hidden layers with 8, 20, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1, 4, 5, and 30 neurons.
- **Model 4:** Seventeen hidden layers with 10, 20, 30, 40, 40, 20, 10, 40, 50, 10, 20, 30, 40, 40, 20, 10, and 40 neurons.

## Results

The results of the models are evaluated based on the accuracy of the predictions on the test data. The accuracy of each model is summarized in a tabular report.

## Report

A detailed report is generated at the end of the R Markdown file, providing insights into the performance of each model configuration.

## Tabular Report

| Number of Hidden Layers | Accuracy (%)  |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| 2                       | 100           |
| 3                       | 93.3333333    |
| 10                      | 100           |
| 17                      | 63.3333333    |

### Conclusion

Increasing the complexity of a neural network by adding more hidden layers and neurons can enhance model performance, as evidenced by the highest accuracy achieved with a model containing 10 hidden layers. However, this improvement is not always guaranteed and heavily depends on the dataset's specific characteristics and the problem at hand. For instance, in model 4, despite increasing the hidden layers to 17, the accuracy decreased to 63.33%, illustrating that a more complex architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance and may even hinder it. Additionally, in terms of RAM consumption, the RAM gauge on the Posit website turned red, indicating that all available memory was consumed, highlighting the increased computational demands and resource constraints associated with overly complex models.
